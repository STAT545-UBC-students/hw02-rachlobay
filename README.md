# What is this repo. for?

This is my assignment for Homework 02: Explore Gapminder and use dplyr for UBC Stat 545A. 

In this repo, you will find an .Rmd file that is an exploration of the gapminder data set. I tested the data set, explored individual variables, explored plot types, and demonstrated that I can use the filter(), select() and %>% functions.
